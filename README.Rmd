# nitratoR

**Explore NEON Data on nitrate level and water temperature of 3 different rivers in the US during 12 months (2023)**  

Tidy datasets • Interactive Shiny App • Reproducible workflow

---

The **nitratoR** package provides clean and ready-to-use water-quality data from three NEON stream sites — *Arikaree* (**ARIK**), *Caribou* (**CARI**), and *Lewis Run* (**LEWI**) — collected during 2023.  
It includes:

- `nitrate_tidy`: monthly nitrate concentrations (µmol/L)  

- `temp_tidy`: monthly surface-water temperatures (°C)  

- `monthly_median()`: a simple helper to extract a site-month median  

- `launch_app()`: an interactive Shiny dashboard to explore patterns visually  

The package was created for learning and communication purposes — showing how to build, document, and deploy an R package with integrated data, functions, and a Shiny app.
