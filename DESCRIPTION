Description: 
    The nitratoR package provides cleaned and tidy datasets of monthly water quality
    data (nitrate and surface water temperature) from three NEON stream sites 
    (Arikaree, Caribou, and Lewis Run) for 2023. It includes functions for quick 
    monthly summaries, and an interactive Shiny dashboard for exploring patterns 
    across sites and months. This package is designed as a learning project for 
    building, documenting, and deploying R packages with shiny apps.
